Build the standalone Windows folder.

Output: dist/Sleight/ - Sleight.exe plus the assets it loads at runtime
(the hand model, a fresh config.json, the docs, and midi2_bridge/publish/
for output_mode = "midi2_ump"). No synth is bundled; by default MIDI goes
out a loopMIDI port to the user's DAW. Zip the folder and send it.
