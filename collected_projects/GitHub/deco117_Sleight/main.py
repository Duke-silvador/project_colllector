    friendliest way to identify it, especially for someone who doesn't know
    or care what their interface is called in Windows.

    This is the step Andrew Mee's first real setup was missing: with only
    one device plugged in, config.json's default (midi_in_match = "", i.e.
    "first port seen") just happens to work - but the moment there's a
    second MIDI input on the system (a DAW's own virtual port, a loopback,
    anything), "first port" can silently be the wrong one, with nothing on
    screen to say so. He ended up hand-editing config.json to fix it; this
    is what should have asked him up front instead. It also matters before
    calibrate()'s own key-range detection runs (first-run calls both) -
    that detection listens on midi_in_match too, so getting the port right
    first is what lets it hear anything at all.

    No prompt at all if there's only one port (the common case) or none
