r"""Run the RaMa-Scene engine over a fixed scenario grid and write one JSON file.

    uv run python precompute.py --run --engine "$ENGINE_DIR" \\
        --data "$DATASETS_DIR" --out data/results.json

The engine is imported as a package and driven the way ramascene.tasks.execute_calc
drives it, without Celery, a broker or channels. Every scenario is an
intervention on the 2011 base year through ramascene.modelling.Modelling; the
engine makes no projection, so nothing here is a forecast.

Scenarios: five named ones (the three original interventions and two of the
page's featured runs; `--scenarios named` runs these) plus a material-efficiency grid,
ten products x five continental regions x three cut sizes (150), all defined
as data below.

Memory and process model: each technical-coefficient scenario works on a dense
9800x9800 A. Each scenario runs in a fresh worker process (this script with
--worker) so its peak RSS is that process's ru_maxrss, measured the way the
engine's own numbers were, and its matrices are gone before the next starts.
--run is required so the full-size path is never started by accident.

Solver: Modelling.apply_model picks it, and this script passes no solver
argument, as tasks.execute_calc does not. The performance engine (PR #74,
split/3-performance) returns a LowRankLeontief, a Woodbury update of the
published L, when few rows of A change and that update passes the engine's own
residual check, and otherwise a LeontiefSolve that factorizes (I - A) once; a
stock engine returns its own L. Each run records the class of the L it got
(runs.<id>.solver), and provenance.run.solvers counts them.

Nothing is written unless the engine first reproduces the four Octave
reference files shipped with RaMa-Scene on the matrices given (checked before
any solve), the baseline matches an independent B . (L . sum Y) per region and the
0% control reproduces the baseline. A scenario that fails a per-scenario check
(non-finite output, regional mismatch, no change, a rise) is recorded as
failed with its reason and left out of the published results; it is never
dropped silently. data_kind is "exiobase-v3" only for output that passed.

--out-embodied adds the flows embodied in final demand (producer country x
section x consumer country) for the baseline and every published scenario,
computed in the same worker from the same Y and L, and written to one Parquet
file with one row group per run. Nothing is written unless they reconcile with
the run's own totals (embodied_of). results.json then records that file's name,
size and SHA-256 under provenance.embodied.
