"""Inspectable evidence for locating completed slskd album folders.

This module deliberately does not decide that a transfer is complete. It only
examines the local download tree after the watcher has established transfer
completion, and explains why a completed folder could not safely be selected.
The existing track matcher remains the authority for filename/size validation.
